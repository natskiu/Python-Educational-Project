# Python-Educational-Project
An education project led by Dr Giuseppe Mallia at the Department of Chemistry at Imperial College London. The project aims to improve our undergraduate programming education through a series of research. This Github repository is created to document the work of Venus Lee (2023). 

## Data
The data was collected with two Qualtric surveys:
1. On student's confidence and satisfaction (work of Gabriel Cuaycong)
2. On contents and learning activities of the formative programming exercises (work of Venus Lee)

Templates of the surveys can be found in the [qualtricSurveyTemplate folder](https://github.com/natskiu/Python-Educational-Project/tree/main/qualtricSurveyTemplates). Just go the the Qualtric website and import the ```.qsf file ``` to generate the survey for distribution. More detail on how to use Qualtric can be found [here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/staff/tools-and-reference/web-guide/tools/qualtrics/).

Gabriel ran the survey 1 in 2022 (Giu should have the data). Venus ran survey 1 and 2 in 2023, and the raw data, both numeric and text, can be found in the [data folder](https://github.com/natskiu/Python-Educational-Project/tree/main/data).

## Analysis
Analysis of the surveys (Venus, 2023) can be found here:
1. [Student's confidence and satisfaction](https://github.com/natskiu/Python-Educational-Project/blob/main/general_analysis.ipynb)
2. [Contents and activities](https://github.com/natskiu/Python-Educational-Project/blob/main/learningActivitiesAnalysis.ipynb)

## Exercises

All the exercises created are stored in the [exercise folder](https://github.com/natskiu/Python-Educational-Project/tree/main/exercises).
